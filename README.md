# The_Helping_Hand

The project was undertaken in 2016-17 as final year B-Tech project at Acharya Narendra Dev College, University of Delhi.

Passive or flex sensor (sensor who's resistance vary as it bends) were used, to pass input to the system. This input was than processed on Aurdino to get the desired result. Computer language C++ was used for the entire project.

The intend of this project was to make an impact in the life of deaf and mute people by providing low cost sign language processing device which can help in their day to day communications. Main chellange was to recognise the hand gestures using shophesticated sensors attached to the hand gloves of the person which would than integrate to produce the output - sound or display on the screen, for other person to communicate.

The prototype was able to recognise certain gestures and interpret as desired. The accuracy was limited due to really high variation in sensor output. The sensors were not very sensitive to the environmental conditions like the temperature. Hence, getting the optimum and continous output was a chellange.

The project had reached to a level where more sophisticated sensors and calibration was required to move further. Due to limited resources and timeframe, the project culminated with a presentation and demonstration before senior professors and external judges. The project was awarded one of the highest scoeres in the entire batch.
