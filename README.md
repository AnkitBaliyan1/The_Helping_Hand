# The_Helping_Hand

The project was undertaken in 2016-17 as final year B-Tech project at Acharya Narendra Dev College, University of Delhi.

We used passive or flex sensor (sensor who's resistance vary as it bends), as input and worked on Aurdino with C++ to get the desired result. 

The intend of this project was to make an impact in the life of deaf and mute people by providing low cost sign language processing device which can help in their day to day communications. 

The prototype was able to recogonize certain gestures and interpret as desired. Due to really high variation in sensor data, the accuracy was limited.

The project had reached to a level where more shophisticated sensors and calibration was required to move further. Due to limited resources and timeframe, the project culminated with a presentation and demonstration before senior professors and external judge awarding one of the highest scoring project of my batch.
